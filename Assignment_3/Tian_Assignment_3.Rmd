This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

1.a Conduct the appropriate t-test for the effect of sex on Flow at T0. What is the t
value?
```{r}
t.test(data = df1,
       x = df1$T0[df1$Sex == "M"],
       y = df1$T0[df1$Sex == "F"],
       alternative = "two.sided",
       var.equal = TRUE,
       paired = FALSE)
```
The t value is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its standard error. It is used in hypothesis testing via Student's t-test. When performing a t-test, the t-value measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in sample data. 



1.b Conduct a one-way ANOVA for the effect of sex on Flow at T0. What is the F
value?

The F value is a value on the F distribution. Various statistical tests generate an F value. The value can be used to determine whether the test is statistically significant.

The F value is used in analysis of variance (ANOVA). It is calculated by dividing two mean squares. This calculation determines the ratio of explained variance to unexplained variance.

The F distribution is a theoretical distribution. There are many of these distributions, and each of them differs based on the degrees of freedom.

The F value and the degrees of freedom of the sources of variance are used to determine the probability of the F value. The probability is the significance value for the test.

```{r}
#Run the ANOVA first
df1.ez <- ezANOVA(data = df1,
                 dv = T0,
                 wid = ID,
                 between = Sex,
                 type = 3,
                 return_aov = TRUE)
df1.ez

```
1.c How does your t value squared (t2) compare to your F value? In general, what
would this signify?

For this case, t value squared (t2) is equal to F value. In general, t-test is a special type of ANOVA that can be used when we have only two populations to compare their means. 





2. For this question, check assumptions and make the appropriate data
transformations: [6 marks]
a. Run a one-way ANOVA to examine whether Flow differs by exercise condition.
Report the ANOVA main effects in a publishable single-line summary.

A significant main effect for exercise condition was found (F=2.82; P=0.047).

```{r}

data_long_1 <- gather(df1, timestamp, measurement, T0:T120, factor_key=TRUE)
data_long_1

#Run the ANOVA first
df2.ez <- ezANOVA(data = data_long_1,
                 dv = measurement,
                 wid = ID,
                 between = Cond,
                 type = 3,
                 return_aov = TRUE)
df2.ez

#Check normality of residuals
qqnorm(df2.ez[["aov"]][["residuals"]])
skewness(df2.ez[["aov"]][["residuals"]])
kurtosis(df2.ez[["aov"]][["residuals"]])
ks.test(x = df2.ez[["aov"]][["residuals"]],
        y = "pnorm",
        mean = mean(df2.ez[["aov"]][["residuals"]]),
        sd = sd(df2.ez[["aov"]][["residuals"]]))

#Check HoV of residuals: ezANOVA already did it for us!

```

2b.First, use t-tests with the Bonferroni correction method toassess main effects
```{r}
pairwise.t.test(x = data_long_1$measurement,
                g = data_long_1$Cond,
                paired = FALSE,
                alternative = "two.sided",
                p.adjust.method = "bonferroni") 
```

2c.Second, use the Tukey’s HSD method to assess main effects.
```{r}
TukeyHSD(x = df2.ez[["aov"]])#post doc 
```
d.Is there a discrepancy between the p-value results from the post-hoc t-tests and the results from the Tukey’s HSD? If so, why might this be?

the Tukey’s HSD conserves the Type I error rate. However, a Bonferonni correction can force your alpha very small, and is seen as a test with low power. 


3. For this question, check all assumptions, make the appropriate data
transformations, run the analyses, summarize the main effects and posthocs in a
publishable format, and make a publishable graph of the primary findings. [10 marks]
a. Run a one-way ANOVA to examine whether flow changes over time.
b. From the results, recreate the classic ANOVA table we have used in lecture

A significant main effect for timecourse was found (F=7.906;
P=5.44e-06). Post-hoc analysis revealed that group T0 was
significantly differ from group T30, T60 and T90 (P=0.00066, P=0.02282, P=.00061).

df3.ez <- ezANOVA(data = data_long_1,

4. For this question, run the analyses, summarize the results and posthocs in a
publishable format and make a publishable graph of the primary findings. [10 marks]
a) Examine whether there is a difference between men and women for the timecourse of blood flow responses (i.e., after T0, T30, T60, T90, and T120) to Sprint exercise.
b) From the results, recreate the classic ANOVA table we have used in lecture.

A significant main effect for Sex was found (F=4.78;
P=0.049). A significant main effect for timestamp was found
(F=2.66, P=0.043). A significant Sex x timestamp interaction was
found (F=2.82, P=0.034). Post-hoc analysis revealed that a difference between men and women for of blood flow responses to Sprint exercise in group T0 (p=0.03) and T60 (p=0.0085).
